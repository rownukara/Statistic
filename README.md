These pdfs comtains the basic of statistic which is important to know before start learning machine learning.

Statistics play a crucial role in machine learning (ML) for several reasons:

Data Analysis: Statistics provides tools and techniques for analyzing and summarizing data. ML algorithms rely heavily on data, and statistical analysis helps in understanding the patterns, relationships, and distributions within the data. This analysis guides the selection of appropriate ML models and the preprocessing of data.

Feature Selection: ML models often require selecting a subset of relevant features or variables from a larger set. Statistical techniques such as correlation analysis, feature importance, and hypothesis testing help identify the most informative features and discard irrelevant or redundant ones. This process improves model performance, reduces dimensionality, and prevents overfitting.

Model Evaluation: Statistics provides methods for evaluating the performance and generalization ability of ML models. Techniques like cross-validation, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals help assess the accuracy, reliability, and uncertainty associated with model predictions. Statistical evaluation enables researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions about model selection and comparison.

Sampling Techniques: In ML, it is common to work with large datasets. However, analyzing the entire dataset can be computationally expensive or impractical. Statistics offers sampling techniques like random sampling, stratified sampling, and bootstrapping to obtain representative subsets of the data for training, validation, and testing purposes. These techniques help in reducing computational resources and ensuring robust model performance.

Probability and Uncertainty: ML models often deal with uncertain or probabilistic outcomes. Statistics provides a solid foundation for understanding probability distributions, Bayesian inference, and probabilistic modeling. These concepts are fundamental to many ML algorithms, such as Bayesian networks, Gaussian processes, and hidden Markov models, which incorporate uncertainty and make probabilistic predictions.

Experimental Design: In ML research and development, statistical experimental design plays a crucial role in designing experiments or simulations to evaluate and compare different models or algorithms. It helps control and account for confounding factors, reduce bias, and optimize resource allocation, resulting in more reliable and interpretable results.

Overall, statistics provides the necessary tools and methodologies to analyze data, assess model performance, handle uncertainty, and make informed decisions in machine learning. It enables researchers and practitioners to extract meaningful insights from data, build robust models, and improve the overall effectiveness of ML systems.
